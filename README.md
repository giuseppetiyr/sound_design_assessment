## Playgame

Just press play and enjoy the sound environment.

There are 2 Atmos tracks for day and night, they are slightly different, the field atmosphere is different to distinguish the 2 parts of the day, but the main core is really similar to keep the patient's relaxation / distraction mood.

I added a sound event to the transition between day and night.

Steps and jumps work with the main character.

You can also find some possible UI sounds in the Audio folder.

Thank you for your time!
